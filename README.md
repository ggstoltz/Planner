If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project and you have an internet connection.

The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML, CSS, and javascript.

## Challenges
8-06-2020
I really stuggled with how to get the time into my project useing the provided api. I was able to get the time though other ways but that was not what this assignmnet was about. Becuase I could not get the time using moment I was also un able to add the required code to have the current hour and future hours have updated css. My local storage also would not link with the buttton presses so the alert I wanted to appear does not work. I did try to expand my knoledge on some css display properties ie the flex method but unsure if my browser fully supports that or if float would be better.
